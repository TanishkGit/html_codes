Emmet is a popular plugin for text editors that greatly improves HTML and CSS workflow.
 It allows you to quickly write code by providing shortcuts, called "abbreviations," which expand into full-fledged code snippets.
 Emmet is particularly useful for web developers because it saves time and reduces the amount of repetitive
  typing required when writing HTML and CSS.
